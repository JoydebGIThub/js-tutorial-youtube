# javascript and classes
```txt
JavaScript have classes. This feature was introduced with ECMAScript 2015 specification (often referred to as ES6). However, its important to note that JS is a "primarily a prototype-based lanuage", and its classes are primarily syntactic sugar over existing prototype-based inheritance mechanisms. In other words, its provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming form class-based language.
